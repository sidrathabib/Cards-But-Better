# Cards-But-Better 

## For this project, I am shadowing Hyperplexed youtube video: [ImNotGoodEnough.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TYkDy54q4E&list=PLbP5K8j2sxDlmpqAhvpF65CSPjfj4d6pJ&index=6)

I will be posting a live and a demo below of the final product once it is completed. 

## Sid's Take 
It's been a while since I've got to work with a team or myself and coded in real life. This is going to be my first mini project since I last developed a full webpage since January. I chose to do this because I ran into this video a while back during the semester but didn't have time to do anything with it since I was busy with my other CS and college classes. Hopefully by going through this, I get to learn a little about the thinking process of a Front-End Developer, especially one that has the anxiety of getting started and breaking things down (like me!). So this should be fun! I'm hoping I can get my **creative juices** flowing and apply my current skills to this and future ideas.
