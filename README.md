Cloning [Brooklyn Cat Cafe's](https://catcafebk.com/) website 

## Sid's Take 
 
Update! Will be keeping this as a mini-project and moving the bigger idea into a fully functional React based website. Redirect to [here](https://github.com/sidrathabib/sidcat-cafe)

Well, looks like I finished shadowing Hyperplexed's video [ImNotGoodEnough.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TYkDy54q4E&list=PLbP5K8j2sxDlmpqAhvpF65CSPjfj4d6pJ&index=6). Incidently, putting cats into the card has inspired me to try to turn this into a cat cafe website. Luckily, Brooklyn Cat Cafe's site has lots of components that I can try to recreate on my own as a nice refresher. I'm looking forward to the *shop* part of it where I can perhaps play with API's and create a fake store (back-end stuff, yeah?).

It's been a while since I've got to work with a team or myself and coded in real life. This is going to be my first mini project since I last developed a full webpage since January. I chose to do this because I ran into this video a while back during the semester but didn't have time to do anything with it since I was busy with my other CS and college classes. Hopefully by going through this, I get to learn a little about the thinking process of a Front-End Developer, especially one that has the anxiety of getting started and breaking things down (like me!). So this should be fun! I'm hoping I can get my **creative juices** flowing and apply my current skills to this and future ideas.
